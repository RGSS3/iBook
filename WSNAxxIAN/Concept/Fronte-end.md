Front-end
---------------
Front-end includes a lot of technology.   
By "front-end", it mainly mean the technology around HTML, CSS, related Javascript and DOM.   
I pick the four definition from `front-end handbook' on https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook/details 
It can be your reading guide on front-end. More information can be found in it.
