JavaScript
--------------
JavaScript is the most popular language on the web.  
By "JavaScript skill" from a piece of recruitment information, it may mean:  

* Typically front-end skills, along with HTML/CSS
* also a requirement of "Node.js skill" or "io.js skill" or "express.js" ... 
* that you are used to this language.
